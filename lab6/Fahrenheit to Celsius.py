'''Your friend Chris wants you to convert Fahrenheit (F) to celsius (C). She has asked you to write a program that displays a table of temperature in C with their values converted to F.  The formula for converting C to F is F =((9/5)*C + 32).   After thinking about this table of values, you decide that you will write a for loop. The list of values that the loop will iterate over will be Celsius(C). In the loop   you will call the range function like this: range(10, 51, 5) . Notice that the third argument specifies 5 as the step value. This means that the numbers in the list will be 10, 15, 20, and so forth. The second
argument specifies 51 as the sequenceâ€™s ending limit, so the last number in the sequence will be 50. Inside the loop you will use the target variable to calculate a Fahrenheit'''


# Loop over a range of temperatures in Celsius
for celsius in range(10, 51, 5):
    # Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
    fahrenheit = (9/5) * celsius + 32
    
    # Display the converted temperature
    print(f"Celsius: {celsius}, Fahrenheit: {fahrenheit}")

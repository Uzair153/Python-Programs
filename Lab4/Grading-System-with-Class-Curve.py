# Develop a Python script to calculate and display the final grades of students. Accept an unknown number of grades until the user decides to stop. For each student, the script should use a `while` loop to ensure entered grades are valid (between 0 and 100). After all grades are entered, find the highest grade and add five points to each studentâ€™s grade (but not exceeding 100). Display the adjusted grades.

def get_valid_grade(prompt):

        try:
            grade = float(input(prompt))
            if grade == -1:
                return grade
            elif 0 <= grade <= 100:
                return grade
            else:
                print("Please enter a valid grade between 0 and 100.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid numerical grade.")
